Building an app is one thing—keeping it secure is another. In this part of Byte-Sized CAPsules: The Bookshop Tales, Alex, Emma, and Byte dive into the world of security. From locking the doors with authentication to managing secrets and auditing actions, this section is all about making sure your CAP application is ready to face the real world.

Each chapter is a story filled with practical advice, code examples, and the occasional laugh. You’ll learn how to:

- Authenticate users and control access.
- Define roles and permissions.
- Isolate tenants and protect data.
- Manage secrets and credentials securely.
- Log and audit actions for accountability.
- Harden your app against real-world threats.

Security isn’t just a feature—it’s a mindset. So grab your coffee, open your editor, and let’s secure the foundations of your CAP application.
