Alex was no stranger to SAP. A seasoned developer, he had recently transitioned to the world of S/4HANA, riding the wave of digital transformation sweeping through his company. But with the migration came a new buzzword that kept popping up in blogs, webinars, and internal meetings—side-by-side extensibility.

And with it, a name: SAP BTP CAPM.

He had read SAP’s recommendation to embrace this model for building scalable, cloud-native extensions. It sounded promising. Clean. Modern. Strategic.

But also… confusing.

So, he did what any developer would do—he Googled it.
And then he Googled it again.
And again.

His browser history became a graveyard of open tabs: official documentation, community blogs, GitHub samples, and a few YouTube videos that promised clarity but delivered chaos. His desk was a battlefield—sticky notes with half-baked ideas, a coffee mug that had seen better days, and a whiteboard filled with arrows pointing nowhere.

He scratched his head, staring at a diagram that looked more like abstract art than architecture.

That’s when she walked by.

Emma, his colleague from the architecture team, paused mid-step. She tilted her head, eyebrows raised.

“You look like you’re trying to decode alien tech,” she said, smirking.

Alex sighed. “Might as well be. I’m trying to wrap my head around CAPM. SAP BTP. Side-by-side extensibility. It’s like learning a new language with no dictionary.”

Emma chuckled and pulled up a chair.

“Alright,” she said, “let’s make this simple. You’re not building an app. You’re building a bookstore.”

Alex blinked. “A bookstore?”

“Yep. But in the cloud. With services, entities, and logic that talk to each other like well-behaved customers in a queue.”

And just like that, the fog began to lift.
