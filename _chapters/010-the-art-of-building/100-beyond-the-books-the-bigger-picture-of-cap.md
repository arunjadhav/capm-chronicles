title: "Beyond the Books — The Bigger Picture of CAP"
---

The Bookshop was live. Customers could browse, buy, and explore. Alex, Emma, and Byte sat back, proud of what they had built.

But Emma, ever the architect, leaned forward.

Emma: “You know, we’ve only scratched the surface of what CAP can do.”

Alex: “Really? We’ve built services, added a UI, deployed it… what else is there?”

Byte pulled up a list, glowing with possibilities.

## 🔐 Security
Byte: “CAP has built-in support for authentication and authorization. You can protect services with roles, scopes, and even integrate with XSUAA on SAP BTP.”
Emma added,

Emma: “You can define access rules right in your CDS models using @requires: 'Admin' or similar annotations.”

## 🕵️ Data Privacy
Emma: “CAP helps you stay compliant with data privacy regulations like GDPR. You can define which fields are sensitive, and even automate data redaction or deletion.”

Alex: “So we can protect user data without reinventing the wheel?”
Byte: “Exactly.”

## 🏢 Multitenancy
Byte: “Want to serve multiple customers from a single app instance? CAP supports multitenancy — with tenant isolation, onboarding, and extensibility built in.”

Emma: “It’s perfect for SaaS scenarios. Each tenant gets their 
own data, but you manage just one codebase.”

---

## 🧩 Extensibility
Emma: “CAP apps are designed to be extended. Partners or customers can add fields, services, or logic — without touching your core code.”

Alex: “So it’s like giving them a safe way to customize?”

Byte: “Exactly. And it’s all metadata-driven.”

---

## ⚡ Performance
Byte: “CAP is optimized for performance too. It supports efficient OData queries, pagination, and even native database features like HANA’s calculation views.”

Emma: “And you can fine-tune things with custom handlers or database-specific logic when needed.”

---

## 🌐 Globalization
Byte: “CAP makes it easier to go global. It has built-in support for multiple languages, currencies, and even date formats.”

Emma: “So we can truly build apps for anyone, anywhere?”

Byte: “Absolutely. And it’s all configurable without code changes.”

---

## 🛠️ Developer Productivity

Byte: “CAP boosts developer productivity with its powerful CLI, VS Code extension, and comprehensive documentation.”  

Emma: “Plus, the community and SAP support are invaluable.”  

Alex: “I’m sold. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of what we can do with CAP.”
