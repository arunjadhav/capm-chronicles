The sun was setting outside the office window, casting a warm glow over the whiteboard filled with entity diagrams and service definitions. Alex leaned back in his chair, a thoughtful look on his face.

Alex: “So far, we’ve been using SQLite for our Bookshop app. It’s been smooth, but… is that what we’d use in production too?”

Emma looked up from her laptop and smiled.

Emma: “Great question. SQLite is perfect for development — it’s lightweight, file-based, and requires zero setup. But for production? We’ve got options.”

Byte, who had been quietly sipping virtual coffee, perked up.

Byte: “Let’s explore them! CAP supports multiple databases, and switching between them is easier than you think.”

🧱 SQLite — The Developer’s Playground
Emma: “Let’s start with what you already know — SQLite. It’s the default in CAP. You don’t even need to configure it explicitly, but here’s what it looks like in package.json or .cdsrc.json.”

Alex: “So that’s why it just worked when I ran cds deploy!”

Byte: “Exactly. It stores data in a local .sqlite file. Great for prototyping, but not for scaling.”

```json
"cds": {
  "requires": {
    "db": {
      "kind": "sqlite",
      "model": ["db"]
    }
  }
}
```

🚀 SAP HANA — The Enterprise Powerhouse

Emma: “Now, when you move to production — especially on SAP BTP — you’ll want SAP HANA. It’s fast, in-memory, and deeply integrated with SAP services.”
She showed Alex the configuration.
Byte: “And when you deploy to BTP, CAP automatically binds to the HANA service instance using environment variables. No need to hardcode credentials.”
Alex: “So I just run cds deploy --to hana and it knows what to do?”
Emma: “Exactly. And if you’re using an MTA project, it’ll even create the service instance for you.”

```json
"cds": {
  "requires": {
    "db": {
      "kind": "hana",
      "model": ["db"]
    }
  }
}
```

🌍 PostgreSQL — The Open-Source Ally

Alex: “What if I’m not on BTP? Can I use something like PostgreSQL?”

Byte: “You can! There’s a community adapter called cds-pg. It lets you use PostgreSQL with CAP.”
Emma pulled up a sample config:

Alex: “Nice! So I can use CAP even if I’m not in the SAP ecosystem.”

Emma: “Exactly. PostgreSQL is great for open-source projects or hybrid environments.”

```json
"cds": {
  "requires": {
    "db": {
      "kind": "postgres",
      "model": ["db"],
      "credentials": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432,
        "database": "bookshop",
        "user": "postgres",
        "password": "secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

🔄 Switching Between Databases

Alex: “But switching between them… doesn’t that get messy?”

Byte: “Not at all. CAP supports profiles. You can define different setups for development, testing, and production.”

Emma showed him how:

```json
"cds": {
  "profiles": {
    "development": {
      "requires": {
        "db": {
          "kind": "sqlite"
        }
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "requires": {
        "db": {
          "kind": "hana"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Emma: “Then just run cds deploy --profile production to switch.”
Alex: “That’s super clean. So I can develop locally with SQLite and deploy to HANA without changing my code?”
Byte: “Exactly. CAP abstracts the database layer so you can focus on your domain model.”

🧠 Wrapping Up

As the lights dimmed and the last lines of code were committed, Alex leaned back with a satisfied grin.

Alex: “So CAP gives me the freedom to start small, scale big, and even go open-source if I want. That’s powerful.”

Emma: “And now you know what’s beneath the shelves of your Bookshop — a flexible, pluggable database layer.”

Byte: “Next stop: deploying to the cloud?”
Alex nodded. “Let’s do it.”
