Let’s be honest—learning something new like CAP can feel like starting a video game with no instructions, no map, and a boss fight right at the beginning. Confusing, right?

That’s where this book comes in. Byte-Sized CAPsules: The Bookshop Tales is a fun and friendly way to learn how to build apps using SAP’s Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). You’ll follow Alex, a developer trying to figure things out, Emma, a smart architect who helps him, and Byte, an AI assistant who’s helpful, funny, and a little sarcastic.

Each chapter is a short story filled with real code, common mistakes, and those great moments when things finally work. This book won’t turn you into a CAP expert overnight, and it doesn’t cover every tiny detail. But it will help you understand the basics, clear up confusion, and make you excited to keep learning and building.

So grab your favorite drink, open your laptop, and enjoy the Bookshop Tales. Just don’t be surprised if you start talking to your code like it’s listening.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Whenever you see a prompt for username and password in these examples, just use `Alice` as the username and leave the password blank. Why? Because Alice is always the first to try things, and she’s too cool for passwords. (CAPM agrees—no password needed for local fun!)
> All the examples you see here have been tested and verified on my local machine using Visual Studio code. However, if something doesn't work quite as expected, don't panic—it's all part of the adventure! Try asking Copilot, Googling the issue, or making a few clever tweaks, and you’ll likely get it running in no time.
>From Part 2, you'll need access to SAP BTP—but don’t worry, a free trial account should do the trick! If you can't set it up, I believe the small stories here should still help you understand the key concepts. After all, it's all about the journey, not just the execution!
