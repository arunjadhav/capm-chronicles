Let’s be honest—learning something new like CAP can feel like starting a video game with no instructions, no map, and a boss fight right at the beginning. Confusing, right?

That’s where this book comes in. Byte-Sized CAPsules: The Bookshop Tales is a fun and friendly way to learn how to build apps using SAP’s Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). You’ll follow Alex, a developer trying to figure things out, Emma, a smart architect who helps him, and Byte, an AI assistant who’s helpful, funny, and a little sarcastic.

Each chapter is a short story filled with real code, common mistakes, and those great moments when things finally work. This book won’t turn you into a CAP expert overnight, and it doesn’t cover every tiny detail. But it will help you understand the basics, clear up confusion, and make you excited to keep learning and building.

So grab your favorite drink, open your laptop, and enjoy the Bookshop Tales. Just don’t be surprised if you start talking to your code like it’s listening.
